## Category 1: Respondent Availability & Substitution

### Q: The respondent is temporarily staying at another house because their house is under repair. They don't know when they'll go back. Can we interview them at the new house?
**A**: Yes. If the respondent does not know when they will return to the original location, interview them at the current/new location. The key concern is completing the interview, not the physical location.

### Q: Is it OK to interview the 2nd knowledgeable respondent today? It's our last day in the barangay and this is our 1st visit to this household.
**A**: If this is the only remaining respondent in the barangay AND you won't be coming back, then yes — proceed to interview the 2nd most knowledgeable respondent. However, if the original respondent is one of two remaining and the other main respondent IS available, interview the available main respondent first.

### Q: The respondent is not home. A neighbor says they went to the market and will be back in 2 hours. What do I do?
**A**: Move to another household and come back in 2 hours. Do not wait. Maximize your time by completing other interviews first. If the respondent is still not available when you return, schedule a revisit for another day.

### Q: The respondent passed away. What do I do?
**A**: Express condolences to the family. Ask if there is another household member who is knowledgeable about the household's affairs and can serve as the respondent. If yes, proceed with the most knowledgeable remaining member. If the entire household has dissolved (no members remaining), mark as permanently unavailable and report to FC.

### Q: The respondent moved to Manila. The ICM participant is still here. What do I do?
**A**: Since the original HH respondent has permanently moved:
1. Find the next most knowledgeable **resident** member to complete the HH survey for the original household.
2. Then conduct the ICM Business Module with the ICM participant (who is still there).
This is Scenario D in the respondent protocol.

### Q: Both the HH respondent and ICM participant have moved away. No one in the household can answer.
**A**: If both are permanently unavailable and no knowledgeable member remains:
- If they moved within the same community or to another community in our sample → attempt to locate and interview at new location
- If moved to a community NOT in our sample → escalate to SRA/NU team
- If completely untraceable → mark as permanently unavailable after 3 attempts

### Q: The respondent says "come back tomorrow." We are here for 3 more days.
**A**: Schedule a revisit for tomorrow. Record the scheduled date/time. Continue with other households today. If the respondent is unavailable again tomorrow, try once more (you have 3 more days). Remember: maximum 3 visits on at least 2 different days before considering alternatives.

### Q: The ICM participant is in the household but refuses to be interviewed. The HH survey is done.
**A**: Respect their decision. Mark the ICM participant survey as "refused." The household is considered complete (HH portion). Do NOT pressure them. Record the refusal reason if they provide one.

## Category 2: SurveyCTO & Technical Issues

### Q: My cases are not showing on my tablet. I've checked and I have internet.
**A**: Try these steps in order:
1. Go to main menu → "Get Blank Form" → download all forms
2. Go back to main menu → check your case list
3. If still missing, confirm your case IDs with your FC and check if they were assigned to you
4. If confirmed assigned but still missing → report to FC with specific case IDs → FC escalates to SRA

### Q: I accidentally submitted a form that wasn't finished. Can it be reopened?
**A**: Submitted forms cannot be edited. Report to your FC immediately with:
- Case ID
- What was missing/incorrect
- FC will escalate to SRA who can determine if the case needs to be reopened for re-interview

### Q: The form is asking about the ICM participant but the ICM participant is not the respondent I'm speaking to. What do I do?
**A**: This is expected in Scenario B or D. The form should have identified that the HH respondent and ICM participant are different people. Complete the HH survey with the current respondent. The form will then prompt you to locate the ICM participant for the ICM Business Module. If the ICM participant is not available, follow the ICM participant availability protocol (Section 4.2 of the main protocol).

### Q: What version should I be using?
**A**: Check the #general or #scto channel for the most recent version announcement. Current versions: [Bot should pull from known_issues_and_fixes.md or from a live data source]. Always "Get Blank Form" at the start of each day.

### Q: SurveyCTO crashed in the middle of an interview. What do I do?
**A**: Don't panic.
1. Go to the main page → tap the 3 dots in the upper-right corner
2. Select "Resume Crashed Form"
3. A pop-up will show saved forms → select the row matching your Case ID
4. Check which responses were saved and resume from where you left off
5. If the form cannot be recovered, report to FC immediately with the Case ID

## Category 3: Survey Content Questions

### Q: The respondent says they own a tricycle they rent out. Is that a business or employment?
**A**: If the respondent **owns the tricycle** and keeps all revenue/pays all expenses → it's a **non-agricultural business** (record in Non-Ag Business module). If they **rent the tricycle from someone else** and keep earnings after paying rent → still a **business**. If they **drive someone else's tricycle for a wage** → it's **employment** (record in Income & Labor module).

### Q: The respondent grows vegetables in their backyard for their own consumption. Do I record this in agriculture?
**A**: The agriculture module is for activities where production is **owned by the household** or **performed by the household**, regardless of whether they sell. Growing vegetables for own consumption qualifies. Record it in the agriculture module. However, if the scale is negligible (e.g., a few herb pots), use your judgment and consult your FC if unsure.

### Q: A household member works abroad (OFW) for 2 years. Resident or non-resident?
**A**: **Non-resident member**. They are away for more than 3 months. Record them in the non-resident roster. Their remittances should be captured in the Income & Labor module under unearned income.

### Q: The respondent says they don't know how much they spent on rice last week. They buy daily in small amounts.
**A**: Use **decomposition probing**: "Let's go day by day — about how much did you spend on rice each day?" Then sum the daily amounts. If they still can't estimate, use **estimation probing**: "Is it closer to ₱100, ₱300, or ₱500 for the whole week?" Record the best estimate. Only use Don't Know (-999) as a last resort after thorough probing.

### Q: The respondent has a sari-sari store AND works as a teacher. How do I record this?
**A**: Both!
- **Teacher job** → Income & Labor module (non-agricultural employment — paid by employer)
- **Sari-sari store** → Non-Agricultural Business module (self-owned business)
One person can be both an employee and a business owner.

### Q: The household has pawned their TV. Do I list it as an asset?
**A**: **No**. If an asset has been pawned and the household received money in exchange, it is no longer owned by the household and should NOT be reported as an asset. This is true even if the household intends to buy it back.

## Category 4: Consent & Sensitive Situations

### Q: The respondent is willing to do the survey but refuses audio recording. Can I proceed?
**A**: Yes. Audio recording consent is separate from survey participation consent. Proceed with the survey without audio recording. Note the refusal in comments.

### Q: A barangay captain is insisting on being present during the interview. What do I do?
**A**: Politely explain that for confidentiality, the interview must be conducted privately with only the respondent present. Show the informed consent sheet if needed. If the captain insists, contact your FC for assistance. Do NOT conduct the interview with unauthorized people present.

### Q: The respondent is asking me for advice about their finances/business based on my questions.
**A**: Stay neutral. You are a researcher, not an advisor. Say: "I appreciate you sharing this with me, but as a researcher, I'm not in a position to give advice. Our role is only to collect information for the study."

## Category 5: Logistics & Finance

### Q: I lost my tablet. What do I do?
**A**: Report to your FC **immediately**. FC reports to FM and SRA. The tablet contains encrypted data (SurveyCTO encryption protects respondent data). You will be provided a replacement if available. Do NOT attempt to continue work without a tablet.

### Q: When do I submit my lump sum allowance request?
**A**: Submit on the **first day** of the allowance request duration. Upload the request form and signed attendance sheet (with correct dates) to the Box folder: Project Lump-sum Allowances. Finance processes requests every **Monday and Thursday**.

### Q: I need to travel to a far barangay and transport cost exceeds ₱250. What do I do?
**A**: Amounts not in the standard allowance table require **prior approval from the Budget Holder**. Discuss with your FC first, who will request approval before you travel.

## How to Add New Scenarios

When the SRA (Aubrey) encounters a new question that isn't covered here:
1. Add the Q&A to the appropriate category
2. If it represents a new rule, also update `protocol.md`
3. The bot will learn from the updated document on next refresh
