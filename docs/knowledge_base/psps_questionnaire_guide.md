# PSPS Household & Individual Survey — Questionnaire Guide

> **Survey**: Philippines Socioeconomic Panel Survey (PSPS)
> **Organizations**: Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Philippines & Global Poverty Research Lab (GPRL) at Northwestern University
> **Purpose**: Long-term panel survey tracking rural households in Western Visayas to provide publicly available data on social and economic conditions
> **Coverage**: Rural households in Western Visayas (Iloilo, Aklan, Antique, Capiz, Negros)

---

## Overview

### Questionnaires

Field Officers complete:
1. **Screening Survey**
2. **Household Survey**
3. **Individual Survey**

Senior Field Officers complete:
4. **Barangay Captain Survey**
5. **Accompaniment and Spot-Check Forms**

### General Principles

- No guide can prepare you for every situation. Understand **what concept each module measures** so you can make good judgment calls. If a question doesn't make sense, ask.
- Treat respondents with respect:
  - Greet warmly
  - Answer all questions before asking for consent
  - Give the paper consent form with contact information
  - Thank them at the end
- **Reading response choices**:
  - **Default**: Do NOT read response options aloud (unless respondent is struggling)
  - **Blue enumerator note says "READ"**: Read them aloud
  - **Blue enumerator note says "DO NOT READ"**: Never read them
  - **NEVER** read aloud: "Don't know", "Refuse to answer", "Not applicable", "None"
- Do not skip ahead or backward — it affects duration calculations
- **You must complete and submit the Household Survey BEFORE opening the Individual Survey** (data is pulled from HH into Individual)
- Do not save a completed survey and go back to edit comments — error risk is too high
- Write comments in whatever language you're most comfortable with

### Roster Rules Across Modules

- All modules cycle through **resident members only**, except Migration
- All **ownership** questions use resident + non-resident roster
- All **care** questions use resident roster only
- Domestic and foreign **remittances** use only the non-resident roster

### Partial Refusal Handling

If a household refuses to continue partway through:
1. Identify the reason (time issue → reschedule; uncomfortable questions → explain confidentiality)
2. FO can proceed, selecting "Refuse to answer" for specific questions
3. If household continues to refuse → **replace the household**

---

## Module 1: Location

**Purpose**: Record how to find the household for future surveys if phone numbers change.

**Instructions**:
- Identify a nearby **permanent landmark** unlikely to change in a few years
  - ✅ Good landmarks: religious buildings, community centers, barangay hall, schools, cemeteries, bridges, rivers
  - ❌ Bad landmarks: sari-sari stores, trees, other households
- Record foot navigation directions from landmark to house
  - Example: *"Locate the barangay hall in the center of the barangay. When facing the front door, this household is the fifth building to the left. The house has a red iron gate."*

---

## Module 2: Respondent Selection

**Purpose**: Identify the most knowledgeable person to answer the Household Survey.

**Rules**:
- Must be a household member **18 years old or older**
- May be the head of household, but could also be someone else — probe carefully
- The respondent **can get help from other household members** — accuracy matters more than one person answering alone
- If household says the most knowledgeable person is a **minor** (<18): an adult/guardian must be present and recorded as the actual respondent; the minor can help with responses
- **Wait** for the most knowledgeable person if they'll be available while the team is in the barangay

---

## Module 3: Consent

**Purpose**: Obtain informed, voluntary permission before proceeding.

**Four consent items**:
1. ✅ **Required**: Conduct the interview and collect data
2. ⬜ Optional: Record audio for quality control
3. ⬜ Optional: Record GPS coordinates
4. ⬜ Optional: Share PII with other researchers for future studies

Survey proceeds only if item (1) is granted. Items (2)-(4) are automatically disabled if not consented.

**Definitions**:
- **PII**: Personally identifiable information — data that can identify an individual alone or combined with other data
- **Consent**: Permission to conduct interview, record audio, record GPS, share PII

**Instructions**:
- Read slowly and clearly
- Point to contact information on the paper consent form when mentioned
- Explain how personal information will be protected
- Reiterate: IPA is NOT part of the government; information will NOT affect 4Ps or other benefits
- Pause after asking consent to allow questions
- For audio recording hesitancy: explain recordings are only for our team's quality checks, never published
- For PII sharing hesitancy: explain household will be invited to future studies with full explanation and separate consent

---

## Module 4: Household Roster

### Definition of "Household"

> All people, including children and non-relatives, who **live together** and have a **common arrangement in the preparation and consumption of food**.

### Household Examples

| Example | Classification | Reasoning |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Intergenerational family in 3 buildings, buy and eat food together | ✅ Single household | Common food arrangement |
| Intergenerational family in 3 buildings, eat as 3 separate groups | ❌ Three separate households | Each group that buys/eats together is its own HH |
| Single man, no family, buys own food | ✅ Single household | Lives alone with own food arrangement |
| Single man, eats most meals at son's house nearby | ❌ Separate households | Unless he consumes ALL food there (unlikely) |
| Family of 4 temporarily living with neighbors after house fire, eating together, contributing to food expense | ✅ Single household (combined) | Live together + share food + share expenses |
| Family of 4 living with neighbors after fire, but buy own food and mostly cook separately | ❌ Separate households | Don't meet both parts of definition |

> ⚠️ Household members ≠ family members. Probe carefully.

### Resident Members

People who **currently live in the household** — NOT away for 3+ months for work/school/caregiving.

**Instructions**:
- Begin with **head of household** (one person only; household decides who; doesn't have to be the interviewee)
  - Head must currently reside in the household
  - If recognized head is away 3+ months → list as non-resident → designate "acting" head
- Record rest of resident members
- Remind respondent: this survey is NOT a government initiative and will NOT affect 4Ps or other support
- Collect: birthdate/age, marital status, relationship to head, gender
- For female members: questions about children and age groups (used for Individual Survey respondent selection)

**Notes**:
- `r_gender`: Do NOT read gender options aloud
- `r_birthdate`: Try to get at least month and year. Use notable events document to jog memory. Only use estimated age as last resort.
- `r_marital`: Couples living together unmarried → select "Married or in committed union and living with a partner"
- Guest/lodger residing and sharing food for 3+ months → resident member
- Daughter "vacationing" for 6 months → ✅ Resident member (residing >3 months)
- Man residing 7 months but eats on own and pays for room → ❌ Not a member (renter, no common food arrangement)

### Non-Resident Members

People who are in another city, country, incarcerated, or at sea for **3+ months** for **WORK or SCHOOL**, but were part of the household before and/or intend to return.

**Examples**:
- OFW in Taiwan for 2 years, intends to return → ✅ Non-resident member
- Wife at mother's house for 1 year caring for ailing mother → ❌ Not a non-resident member (reason is caregiving, not work/school)

**Notes**:
- No migration questions for non-residents (their status already implies migration)
- Incarcerated persons who lived in household before and intend to return → mark as "Other" destination, specify "jail" or "prison"

---

## Module 5: Household Phones

**Purpose**: Collect up to 3 members' phone numbers for future contact (rescheduling, future studies). Secondary purpose: identify phone owners for potential future phone-based studies.

---

## Module 6: Individual Survey Respondent Selection

**Purpose**: Select the respondent for the Individual Survey based on specific criteria.

**Selection priority** (in order of preference):
1. Female, 18–45 years old, with child aged 3–8
2. Female, 18–45 years old, with child ≤15
3. Female, 18–45 years old (no children requirement)
4. Female, older than 45
5. **No adult female available** → do NOT conduct Individual Survey

- If multiple members fit the same criteria → household chooses (do NOT guide their choice)
- If preferred respondent exists but is unavailable during survey period → move to next criteria

---

## Module 7: Education

**Purpose**: Collect schooling background for all members age 3+ and education expenditures.

**Structure**:
- For each member 3+: currently enrolled? If not, why?
- Not attending: ever attended? Highest level completed?
- Never attended: reason?
- Currently attending: where they live, school type/name, grade, school absences and reasons
- Members aged 4–8: pre-primary/preschool enrollment questions

**Definitions**:
- **Vocational certificate**: Degree for preparation of a specific job/task
- **Associate's degree**: 2-year degree after high school
- **Alternative Learning System (ALS)**: Opportunities for out-of-school youth/adults to develop literacy and complete basic education
- **Science high school**: Research-focused school associated with Dept. of Science and Technology
- **Out of pocket**: Money the household spent themselves (not scholarships, government support, etc.)
- **Academic year**: First to last day of school including holidays (generally August to July)

**Key Notes**:
- Student on vacation → still "enrolled"
- Highest level **COMPLETED** = grade they passed
  - Dropped out mid-Grade 7 → highest completed = Grade 6
  - Failed 12th grade and dropped out → highest completed = Grade 11
- "Education beyond college" = post-undergraduate (Masters, Doctoral)
- `edu_completed` vs `edu_sch_type`:
  - `edu_completed`: Record the grade completed (e.g., "6th Grade/elementary graduate") — do NOT enter school type here
  - `edu_sch_type`: Type of school (Public, Private, ALS, etc.)

**Philippine Education Systems**:

| Era | System | Structure |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| 1901–1945 | K-11 | Elementary (Gr 1-7) → High School (4 years) → College |
| 1945–2017 | K-10 | Elementary (Gr 1-6) → High School (4 years) → College |
| 2012–present | K-12 | Elementary (Gr 1-6) → Junior HS (Gr 7-10) → Senior HS (Gr 11-12) → College |

### Education Expenses

- Cycle through each member (resident + non-resident) currently attending school
- Record spending on: tuition, books, uniforms, transport, etc. — **only what the household paid themselves**
- If no spending for an item → enter 0
- Two scholarship questions:
  1. Scholarship from organization/government
  2. Money from family members outside the household
- If multiple scholarships → report TOTAL value of all

---

## Module 8: Migration

### Migration Experiences

**Purpose**: Capture domestic and international migration history.

**Relevant to**:
- Resident members who left the barangay for **3+ consecutive months in the last 5 years**
- Non-resident members listed as away for work

**Structure**:
- Number of times migrated, total time away
- If migrated once: year, duration, destination, reason, employment, financial support
- If migrated 2+ times: same questions for **first** and **most recent** migration

**Notes**:
- If member hasn't returned (non-resident): enter expected total duration
- `mig_startyr`: Start year — NOT restricted to last 5 years
- `mig_lgth`: Time away limited to last 5 years from survey date
  - Example: Migrated Jan 2017, returned Jan 2022. Last 5 years = 2019–2024. Time away = 3 years
- Short holiday returns (<3 months) = same round of migration, NOT a new one
- Employment questions: only for members 10+ years old
- "Family at destination" includes both family who migrated with them AND family already at destination
- Ship workers classification:
  - Deep sea fishing vessel → "Fishing"
  - Oil drilling/cargo hauling ship → "Crew on ship"
  - Coast guard vessel → "Work for Barangay/public services (Government)"
  - Cruise ship (sailing roles) → "Crew on ship"
  - Cruise ship (services: waiter, maid, masseuse) → "Services"
- Incarcerated members → "Other" → specify "jail" or "prison"

### Push & Pull Factors

- Asked only of the respondent, only if **under 50 years old**
- 10 questions on how factors of life influence desire to stay vs. migrate
- **Remain neutral** — do not impose personal views

---

## Module 9: Consumption

**Purpose**: Measure household wellbeing through spending patterns.

### Food, Beverage & Tobacco (Last 7 Days)

- Select all food items consumed by any member in last 7 days
- **Consumed** ≠ **Purchased** — include gifts, own production, gathered items
- For each item: source (purchased/produced/gift), quantity, value
- Includes prepared food and drinks consumed outside the household

### Non-Food Consumption (Variable Recall Periods)

| Category | Recall Period |
|----------|--------------|
| Fuel, power, transport, communication | Last 30 days |
| Clothing | Last 6 months |
| Taxes and fees | Last 12 months |

- Select items purchased, produced, or received in-kind/as gifts
- 4 additional questions on selected items consumed in last 6 months

### Key Notes

- **Consumed ≠ Purchased** — always remind respondents
- Use provided standard and local units; specify "Other" only if not in list
- If respondent gives two units for same item → convert to single unit
  - Example: 3 bottles × 500ml beer + 2 bottles × 330ml beer = 2,160ml
- Help with calculations when needed
  - Example: 2 gantang rice purchased, 4kg consumed. 1 gantang = 2.5kg = ₱100. So 1kg = ₱40. Value consumed = 4 × ₱40 = ₱160
- Confirm odd-sounding quantities/values with respondent
- Some questions won't appear for irrelevant items (e.g., no "own production" for petrol)
- **Exclude** business/work expenses — this module is personal consumption only
- Help respondents estimate if they struggle; they can consult other members
- **NOT in this module** (captured elsewhere):
  - Agriculture/fishing/livestock/forestry expenses → Agriculture module
  - Education expenses → Education module
  - Health expenses → Health module
  - Large asset purchases/repairs → Assets module
- **Item-specific**:
  - Rent: does NOT include rent for cultivated plots (→ Agriculture module)
  - Firewood: can be "home production" if collected
  - Clothing for boys/girls: age cutoff is below 18
  - Big events/functions with meals → `service_1: expenditure on functions`

---

## Module 10: Income & Labor

**Purpose**: Capture all income sources and labor supply for resident members.

### Structure (Layered Screeners)

```
All residents 13+ → Any WORK in last 30 days?
├── YES → Any EARNED INCOME in last 30 days?
│         ├── Agriculture employment
│         └── Non-agriculture employment
└── NO → Reasons for not working

All residents 6+ → Any UNEARNED INCOME in last 12 months?
├── Foreign remittances
├── Domestic remittances
├── Gifts
├── Government support
├── Religious/NGO/charity support
└── Other (rental income, social security, pension, etc.)
```

### Agriculture vs. Non-Agriculture Work

**Agriculture** (shorthand for):
- Farming (growing crops, e.g., rice)
- Raising livestock (cows, chickens, pigs — for meat, milk, eggs, hides, sport)
- Forestry (raising trees, forest conservation, e.g., planting bamboo)
- Fishing (catching fish, harvesting pearls, seaweed, all ocean/freshwater income activities)

**Non-Agriculture** (everything else):
- Government, retail (sari-sari), NGO, construction, healthcare, education, etc.

### Key Notes

- `work_any_30d`: "Snacks" = any food the household sells for income
- Income classification:
  - Share of profits from friend's business → Other unearned income
  - Occasional interest from loan to friend → Other unearned income
  - Regular money lending → Non-agriculture business
- **Irregular work**: Piecework/commission-based; report total received in last 30 days for all assignments
- Hours: if <1 hour, convert to decimal (e.g., 30 min = 0.5 hours)
- `nonagwork_occ`: Domestic work vs. Services:
  - **Domestic work**: Works full-time in ONE household (childcare, cooking, cleaning); may/may not live there
  - **Services** (maid, gardener): Goes house to house doing one type of work
- **Remittances vs. Gifts**:
  - Remittances = regular/semi-regular support for living expenses or school from someone working elsewhere
  - Gifts = irregular money/in-kind for occasions (birthday, holiday)
  - Gifts: only from people OUTSIDE the household
- **Government support questions** (two similar but different):
  1. "Do programs like 4Ps **target** the people who need help most?" → About directing aid to the RIGHT people
  2. "Do programs provide **sufficient support**?" → About whether aid is ENOUGH
- **Types of work**:
  - Shift work: Set hours (e.g., 9am–5pm) — nurses, factory workers
  - Piece work: Paid per piece by bulk buyer (e.g., ₱100/bag for 500 bags)
  - Seasonal work: Only exists during certain seasons (e.g., extra holiday workers)
- **"Last 7 days" vs. "typical week"**:
  - Last 7 days = specific 7 days before interview date
  - Typical week = any normal Sunday–Saturday week

---

## Module 11: Agriculture

**Purpose**: Capture information on household-owned agriculture activities, costs, and revenues.

**Five sub-modules**: Plots & Crops, Livestock, Poultry, Fishing, Forestry

> ⚠️ This module is for activities **owned by the household** or **performed by household members for themselves**. If a member works on someone else's farm for wages → Income & Labor module, NOT here.

### 11.1 Plots & Crops

- Household owns or rents cultivated plots? Area? Crops grown?
- Time spent working for each member involved
- For each crop: seasonality, production quantity, revenue from sales
- Who receives/controls earnings; sources of capital/credit

**Notes**:
- Module is relevant if anyone is involved in farming where production is owned by them (selling not required)
- Rice = **Palay** (harvested with coat, NOT milled rice)
- Coconuts = with shell (not de-shelled); alternatively select "pieces" as unit
- Confirm odd quantities/values with respondent

**Definitions**:
- **Cost of selling**: Additional costs to sell products (transport to market, stall rental, advertising, commissions)
- **Cost of procuring inputs**: Costs above the input price (travel to buy, commissions, hiring labor to purchase)

### 11.2 Livestock

- Types owned or raised (including for others)
- Ownership, purchases, care, decision makers for each type
- Aggregate costs and revenue from sales
- Livestock products (if produced): type, revenue
- Earnings control; capital/credit sources

- **Heifer**: Female cattle that has not had offspring
- **Steer/Bullock**: Young neutered male cattle, primarily for beef

**Notes**:
- Includes both owners AND those raising others' livestock
- **Purchased feed**: Cost of buying fodder (hay, straw, grains, legumes)
- **Own produced feed**: Fodder household produced themselves (crop residue, grass from own plot) — if own-produced, ask estimated market value
- `lv_total_raise`, `lv_total_own`: Number CURRENTLY owned/raising. If all sold/died → enter 0 and record what happened
- Resale value: remind respondent to consider age, health, and likelihood of sale

### 11.3 Poultry

Structure identical to Livestock section.

- **Purchased feed**: wheat, corn, soybean, etc.
- **Own produced feed**: e.g., wheat from own plot processed into feed — ask estimated market value
- `pltry_total_raise`, `pltry_total_own`: Same rule as livestock — enter 0 if all gone, record what happened

### 11.4 Fishing

Covers catching, gathering, harvesting fish/aquatic products. Aggregate questions on sales, costs, revenue, capital, credit.

### 11.5 Forestry

Covers tree planting, gathering forestry products, hunting wild animals/birds. Aggregate questions on sales, costs, revenue, capital, credit.

### Module-Level Notes

- **Borrowings** for agriculture activities are asked HERE, not in the Credit module
- **Agriculture labor vs. business**:
  - Labor = hired to work on someone else's agriculture business, gets paid
  - Business owner = owns the agriculture activity, may/may not hire others

---

## Module 12: Non-Agricultural Business

**Purpose**: Capture information about household-owned businesses that are NOT agriculture.

**Definition**: Income-generating activities where household members **work for themselves** (own a business). If they receive pay from others → employed (Income & Labor module).

> One person can own a business AND be employed elsewhere.

### Classification Examples

| Scenario | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| Man farms rice on rented plot + runs tire shop with wife | 2 businesses: rice farm (Agriculture) + tire shop (Non-Ag Business) |
| Man farms rice on 10 plots, employs 5 harvest workers | 1 business: rice farm (Agriculture) |
| Man is temporary harvest laborer; wife runs sari-sari; they raise chickens | Chickens (Agriculture) + Sari-sari (Non-Ag Business) + Man's labor job (Income & Labor) |
| Woman works as barangay health worker | Employee of local government (Income & Labor) |
| Man runs carpentry shop, works alone on projects | 1 business: carpentry (Non-Ag Business) |
| Woman sews bags paid per piece by organization | Employee — piece work (Income & Labor) |

### Structure

- Number of non-ag businesses owned
- For each: industry, capital sources, credit, member owners, earnings sharing/control
- Profits: categorized by low, typical, and high sales periods
- Time spent working by each member, split by sales periods

---

5. **Furniture**: Purchases and costs as a category (not individual pieces)
6. **Appliances**: Select all owned → quantity, purchase cost (new vs. secondhand)

### Key Notes

- Distinction between **brand new** and **secondhand** purchases — record quantity and total price separately
- Only items **owned** by household members (resident or non-resident)
- **Installment loans**:
  - "Total price when purchased" → report the purchase price (e.g., ₱15,000)
  - Outstanding loan amount → report in **Credit module** (e.g., ₱14,250 remaining)
- **Pawned items**: No longer owned → do NOT report as asset (even if intend to buy back)
- **Housing** covers both house AND lot
- **Land** = land without a house; includes cultivation land
- **Cell phones ≠ wireless telephones**: Cell phones have wide coverage + SIM cards; wireless phones have charging base + limited range + no SIM

---

## Module 14: Health

### 14.1 Illnesses & Disease Prevalence

- All resident members: any illness/injury in last 4 weeks?
- If yes: what illness/injury, pause in normal activities, hospital overnight stay, insurance coverage

- If respondent is uncomfortable about vaccination reasons → assure confidentiality, seek privacy

### 14.3 Healthcare Access

- Facilities: barangay health center, hospital, pharmacy, dental clinic, mental health services
- For each: visited in last 12 months? Provider present? Wait time?

### 14.4 Healthcare Expenses (Last 12 Months)

Three categories — **household aggregate** (not per member):
1. Medical products
2. Outpatient medical services
3. Inpatient medical services

**Definitions**:
- **Outpatient**: Treatment without hospital admission
- **Inpatient**: Treatment while staying in hospital/facility
- **Dietary supplements**: Tablets, pills, powders, liquids for nutrients beyond regular diet

**Notes**:
- Only include expenses **paid by the household** — exclude insurance/third-party coverage

---

## Module 18: References

**Purpose**: Collect contact information for future interviews/studies.

- Up to 5 references with contact details
- Read phone numbers aloud to confirm
- If no mobile network area → "there are no references"

---

## Module 19: Reclassifying Members

**Purpose**: Correct misclassification of resident/non-resident members.

## Individual Survey

### General Notes

- Quite different from Household Survey in tone and format
- Some components are **randomized** (questions skipped or response choices reordered) — read as presented
- Some components skip based on age/children criteria — this is intentional
- **Privacy is essential** — ask others to leave; some questions are sensitive
- It's fine to survey outside the home if respondent prefers and there's privacy
- **Visual aids**: Blue enumerator notes indicate which to use; point to numbers; let respondent hold if preferred
- For scale questions: read ALL options (not just endpoints) for first 1–2 questions, repeat as needed
- Minimize "Don't know" / "Refuse to answer" — ask for best guess, emphasize no right/wrong answers, emphasize confidentiality
- Respondent can look at tablet UNLESS note says "DO NOT READ CHOICES"
- `[If prompt is needed:]` — only read if respondent seems confused
- Ask questions **exactly as written** — same way for every respondent
- Stay neutral — no surprise, approval, or disapproval
- Never make up or suggest responses

### Individual Survey Modules

#### Life Satisfaction
- 2 questions: satisfaction and peacefulness (1–10 scale)
- Each scale has its own meaning for 1 and 10 — read slowly

#### Personal Values
- 6 questions: qualities to teach children (read 11 options twice before selecting) + 4 agree/disagree statements
- Use 5-point visual aid for agree/disagree

#### Aspirations & Subjective SES

**Income Aspirations**:
- Current total household income (all sources, last 12 months)
- Desired income in 5 years
- Current household assets value
- Desired assets in 5 years
- Satisfaction with current financial status
- Help calculate using phone calculator — keep phone charged!
- If hesitant → approximation is OK
- **NEVER** suggest an amount, even if you remember from HH Survey

**Subjective SES & Expected Mobility**:
- 8 questions using 10-step ladder
- Current/desired social status in community
- Current/desired economic status in Filipino society
- "Community" = whatever is meaningful to respondent (if confused → barangay)
- "Filipino society" = all people in the Philippines
- **Like vs. Expect**: Like = aspiration/desire; Expect = realistic expectation
- Point to top (10 = highest) and bottom (1 = lowest) of ladder; middle = average

#### Community Engagement & Trust

**SASCAT** (13 questions):
- Group membership, help given/received, community problem-solving, government engagement
- Trust and cooperation in community
- Long lists of groups — read slowly; respondents may answer yes/no as you read each
- Don't read "None" aloud

**Trust** (3 questions):
- Trust in relatives, neighbors, strangers
- Use 5-point visual aid

**Economic Connectedness**:
- Number of friends, socioeconomic status of friends

- Middle 2 questions are reverse-coded — read choices as listed
- Use 5-point visual aid

**Attitudes Towards Inclusive Growth**:
- Government, individual, and corporate roles in addressing poverty
- All 5-point scale but options change 3 times — re-read each time

**Attributions for Poverty & Success**:
- Causes of wealth vs. poverty; attitudes about economic mobility
- Use 4-point visual aid first, then switch to 5-point

#### Self & Social Worth, Resilience

**Self & Social Worth**: Views on personal capabilities and community perception

**Self-Efficacy & Grit**: Confidence in capabilities, goal orientation
- Long series — repeat response options as needed

**Sense of Control**: Control over life outcomes

**Optimism & Predictive Measures**: Decision-making and problem-solving

All use 5-point scale.

#### Risk & Time Preferences

- 2 questions on risk-taking in business + 2 on risk in personal life
- Ensure respondent understands business vs. personal distinction — people may have different tolerances

#### Mental Health (Kessler 6)

- 6 sensitive questions on psychological distress
- **Ensure no one else is around**
- Emphasize "during the past 30 days"
- Use 5-point visual aid

#### Child's Education (for children aged 3–8)

Cycles through children where respondent is mother/primary caregiver.

**Educational Aspirations**:
- Desired attainment; likelihood of university at different scholarship amounts
- "Academically prepared" = gained necessary skills in high school for university
- "Afford to send" = given financial support, can cover all education expenses through 4-year program
- "All things considered" = leaving aside everything else that could influence the decision
- Use 7-point visual aid

**Returns to Education**:
- Expected future earnings by education level
- These are **expectations**, not desires

**Time Investment**:
- How much time mother/father/other members spend with child on enriching activities
- Order of mother/father/other is randomized
- "Mother"/"Father" includes any primary caregiver (grandparent, aunt/uncle, older sibling)
- Other members = 13+ years old
- Father and other member sections disabled if they don't exist

**Knowledge about Higher Education Programs**:
- Some questions read options aloud, others don't — follow enumerator notes carefully
- `know_free_1`: Free tuition at state universities/colleges
- `know_tes_1`: Tertiary education subsidy program
- `know_loan_1`: Student loan program in higher education

**Child Labor Perceptions**:
- Sensitive topic — no judgment
- First question: select one option among many — read all through at least once before accepting answer
- Second question: randomized — either about child labor law OR minimum voting age law. Do NOT tell respondent about randomization

#### Health Behaviors & Attitudes

- 10 questions on health behaviors
- Maintain **neutral** facial expression, tone, and word choice — respondents may fear judgment

#### Women's Agency & Empowerment

**Requires privacy** — ensure partner/spouse and family cannot hear.

**Intrahousehold Communication**:
- How families make decisions on important topics
- Questions about children's decisions skipped if no children
- Same response choices throughout — read fully at first, repeat as needed
- "Not discussed among household members" ≠ N/A
- N/A = topic doesn't apply to the household

**Family Planning**:
- Restricted to women **under 45**
- If menopausal → ask about most recent contraception used
- Read contraception options slowly
- Ensure privacy; reiterate consent: *"We will be asking about contraception. You can choose not to answer any question that makes you uncomfortable..."*

#### Religion

**Religious Beliefs**: Beliefs regarding religious teachings + behavioral questions
- "God" = respondent's own interpretation
- Stay neutral

**Moral Values**: Same questions asked twice:
1. What do you personally think?
2. What does your religion teach?
- Order is randomized
- "Personal beliefs" = beliefs held inside herself, regardless of others/society
- "What your religion teaches" = official teachings, whether or not she agrees
- Read slowly to ensure respondent understands the distinction
- Stay neutral on sensitive topics

#### Climate Change

- Knowledge and perception about causes and effects
- 2 questions allow multiple responses with long choice lists — read carefully, twice if needed
- `climate_7` vs `climate_8`:
  - 7 = government actions to **prevent worsening** climate change (cause)
  - 8 = government actions to **reduce/prevent negative effects** of existing climate change (effect)

#### Phone Usage

Three topics:
1. Phone use: ownership/access, internet use on phone, cell service rating, phone activities
2. Internet use: access points, frequency
3. Willingness to be contacted for future interviews/programs via SMS, call, or Messenger
